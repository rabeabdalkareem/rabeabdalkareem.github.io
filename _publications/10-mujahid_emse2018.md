**Abstract:** Wearable apps are becoming increasingly popular in recent years. Nevertheless,
              to date, very few studies have examined the issues that wearable apps face. Prior studies
              showed that user reviews contain a plethora of insights that can be used to understand quality issues and help developers build better quality mobile apps. Therefore, in this paper,
              we mine user reviews in order to understand the user complaints about wearable apps. We
              manually sample and categorize 2,667 reviews from 19 Android wearable apps. Additionally, we examine the replies posted by developers in response to user complaints. This
              allows us to determine the type of complaints that developers care about the most, and to
              identify problems that despite being important to users, do not receive a proper response
              from developers. Our findings indicate that the most frequent complaints are related to
              Functional Errors, Cost, and Lack of Functionality, whereas the most
              negatively impacting complaints are related to Installation Problems, Device
              Compatibility, and Privacy & Ethical Issues. We also find that developers mostly reply to complaints related to Privacy & Ethical Issues, Performance
                                                                                        Issues, and notification related issues. Furthermore, we observe that when developers reply, they tend to provide a solution, request more details, or let the user know that they
                                                                                        are working on a solution. Lastly, we compare our findings on wearable apps with the study
                                                                                        done by Khalid et al. (2015) on handheld devices. From this, we find that some complaint
                                                                                        types that appear in handheld apps also appear in wearable apps; though wearable apps have
                                                                                        unique issues related to Lack of Functionality, Installation Problems,
                                                                                        Connection & Sync, Spam Notifications, and Missing Notifications.

                                                                                        which developers should pay additional attention to due to their negative impact.
