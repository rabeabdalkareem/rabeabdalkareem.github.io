**Abstract:** Wearable apps are becoming increasingly popular
              in recent years. However, to date, very few studies examined
              the issues that wearable apps face. Prior studies showed that
              user reviews contain a plethora of insights that can be used
              to understand quality issues and help developers build better
              quality mobile apps. Therefore, in this paper, we mine user
              reviews in order to understand the user complaints of wearable
              apps. We manually sample and categorize 589 reviews from 6
              Android wearable apps. Our findings indicate that the most
              frequent complaints are related to functional errors, lack of
              functionality, and cost. Our results are useful to the wearable
              developer community since they highlight the issues that users
              face and care most about.
