**Abstract:** Technical debt refers to the phenomena of taking
              shortcuts to achieve short term gain at the cost of higher
              maintenance efforts in the future. Recently, approaches were
              developed to detect technical debt through code comments,
              referred to as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). Due to
              its importance, several studies have focused on the detection of
              SATD and examined its impact on software quality. However,
              preliminary findings showed that in some cases SATD may live
              in a project for a long time, i.e., more than 10 years. These
              findings clearly show that not all SATD may be regarded as
              ‘bad’ and some SATD needs to be removed, while other SATD
              may be fine to take on.
              Therefore, in this paper, we study the removal of SATD. In
              an empirical study on five open source projects, we examine
              how much SATD is removed and who removes SATD? We also
              investigate for how long SATD lives in a project and what
              activities lead to the removal of SATD? Our findings indicate
              that the majority of SATD is removed and that the majority is
              self-removed (i.e., removed by the same person that introduced
              it). Moreover, we find that SATD can last between approx. 18–172
              days, on median. Finally, through a developer survey, we find that
              developers mostly use SATD to track future bugs and areas of
              the code that need improvements. Also, developers mostly remove
              SATD when they are fixing bugs or adding new features. Our
              findings contribute to the body of empirical evidence on SATD,
              in particular evidence pertaining to its removal.
