**Abstract:** We advocate for a paradigm shift in supporting the
information needs of developers, centered around the concept
of automated on-demand developer documentation. Currently,
developer information needs are fulfilled by asking experts or
consulting documentation. Unfortunately, traditional documentation
practices are inefficient because of, among others, the manual
nature of its creation and the gap between the creators and
consumers. We discuss the major challenges we face in realizing
such a paradigm shift, highlight existing research that can be
leveraged to this end, and promote opportunities for increased
convergence in research on software documentation.
