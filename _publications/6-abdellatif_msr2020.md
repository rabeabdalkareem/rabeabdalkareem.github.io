**Abstract:** Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular due to their benefits in
              saving costs, time, and effort. This is due to the fact that they allow
              users to communicate and control different services easily through
              natural language. Chatbot development requires special expertise
              (e.g., machine learning and conversation design) that differ from the
              development of traditional software systems. At the same time, the
              challenges that chatbot developers face remain mostly unknown
              since most of the existing studies focus on proposing chatbots to
              perform particular tasks rather than their development.
              Therefore, in this paper, we examine the Q&A website, Stack
              Overflow, to provide insights on the topics that chatbot developers are interested and the challenges they face. In particular, we
              leverage topic modeling to understand the topics that are being
              discussed by chatbot developers on Stack Overflow. Then, we examine the popularity and difficulty of those topics. Our results show
              that most of the chatbot developers are using Stack Overflow to
              ask about implementation guidelines. We determine 12 topics that
              developers discuss (e.g., Model Training) that fall into five main
              categories. Most of the posts belong to chatbot development, integration, and the natural language understanding (NLU) model
              categories. On the other hand, we find that developers consider
              the posts of building and integrating chatbots topics more helpful
              compared to other topics. Specifically, developers face challenges
              in the training of the chatbot’s model. We believe that our study
              guides future research to propose techniques and tools to help the
              community at its early stages to overcome the most popular and
              difficult topics that practitioners face when developing chatbots.
