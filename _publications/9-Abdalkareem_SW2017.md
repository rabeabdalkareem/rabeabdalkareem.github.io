**Abstract:** Stack Overflow relies on the crowd to construct
              quality developer-related knowledge. What developers use the
              crowd constructed knowledge on Stack Overflow for is an open
              question. We answer this question, by analyzing 1,414 Stack
              Overflow related commits and observe that developers use this
              crowd based knowledge to support development tasks and to
              collect user feedback. We also studied the helpfulness and delay
              of Stack Overflow posts by identifying the type of questions that
              are more likely to be answered by the crowd. We find that development tools and programming language issues are areas where
              the crowd is most helpful and that web framework related issues
              are the most time consuming questions to receive an accepted
              answer for. Our findings can help developers better understand
              how to effectively use Stack Overflow as a development support
              tool, help Stack Overflow designers to improve their platform,
              and the research community to understand the strengths and
              weaknesses of Stack Overflow as a development tool.
